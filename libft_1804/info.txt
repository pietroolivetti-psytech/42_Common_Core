The command to compile is the following:

cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c -L. -lft -o test

-L.: Tells the compiler to look for libraries in the current directory.
-lft: Links against libft.a (the lib prefix and .a suffix are assumed).

CONST: Enhanced Type Safety: By using const, you can ensure that values are not accidentally modified,
reducing the chance of bugs and errors in your code. Improved Optimization: Compilers can optimize const variables more effectively,
as they know that their values will not change during program execution

SIZE_T: size_t is an unsigned long (%lu in printf)
size_t ensures they can handle large strings without running into negative values.
